Typing Test

by Ajay Rangarajan


Patterns used:

	Modified version of MVC with 2 Views and 1 Controller 
	Here controller acts a mediator between the two view's - The two text areas being 
	View1 and the TimerPanel being the View2.The data from View1 will be directed to 
	the controller which updates the View2 and thus populates all the statistics.
	Thus the controller avoid tight coupling between the two Views.
	
Features:

	White Space and new line is considered as characters.So if a user repeatedly 
	presses white spaace it will add to the character count and the test stops when
	the character count becomes equal to the length of the sample test string.
	
	A highlighter is used for highling the next word to be typed in the sample 
	test String.The highlighter moves from one word to another when a user enters 
	a white space. If the user continously enter white space, the highlighter remains
	in the same position.
	
	A refresh button is placed at the bottom of the timer panel. This button can be used
	by the user to change a sample test string at any point of the test.Clicking the 
	button randomly selects a sample string from a collection of 10 string from a 
	string factory which can be edited at any time to add more strings.
	
Naming Convention Used:

	All methods are camel case
	All variable names are camel case
	Class and Interface names start with Uppercase letters
